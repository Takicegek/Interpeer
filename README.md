# Interpeer
Interpeer is the new censorship free, peer-to-peer world-wide-web that supports web2.0, also a market place for massively parallel processing tasks and redundant data storage.

in essence Interpeer does for the world-wide-web what [bitTorrent](www.bittorrent.com) does for file-sharing; each interpeer-site is hosted by other peers, which makes it very difficult to destroy, also authors can upload sites anonymously. But unlike bitTorrent, the site is not static data; so to continue the analogy, it would be equivalent of uploading [wikipedia.org](www.wikipedia.org) onto bitTorrent, and users still being able to edit pages.

key innovations:
- almost indestructible hosting similar to bitTorrent but for dynamic websites.
- supports web2.0 sites for dynamic user modifiable content.
- seamless transition from the current world-wide-web.
- massively distributed parallel computing.
- peer consensus can stop updates.
