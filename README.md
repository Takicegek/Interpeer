# Interpeer
in essence Interpeer does for the world-wide-web what [bitTorrent](www.bittorrent.com) does for file-sharing; each interpeer-site is hosted by other peers, which makes it very difficult to destroy, also authors can upload sites anonymously to the network. But unlike bitTorrent, the site is not static data; so to continue the analogy, it would be equivalent of a torrent that other users could edit, making it possible for interpeer-sites to have dynamic content like [wikipedia.org](www.wikipedia.org) with only very slight changes from the standard website design method.

Interpeer is the new censorship free, peer-to-peer world-wide-web that supports web2.0, also a market place for massively parallel processing tasks and redundant data storage.

key innovations:
- almost indestructible hosting similar to bitTorrent but for dynamic websites.
- supports web2.0 sites for dynamic user modifiable content.
- seamless transition from the current world-wide-web.
- massively distributed parallel computing.
- peer consensus can stop updates.
